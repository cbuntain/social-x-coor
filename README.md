# Study of Coordinated Action Across Platforms

Near-term Objective: Publish a paper comparing troll behavior on Twitter and Reddit

Title: A Quantitative, Cross-Platform Study of the Russian Information Campaign During the 2016 Election

Context: Under the assumption that the IRA has a set of strategic goals, behavior of IRA trolls *across platforms* should exhibit goal-directed consistency. Prior work suggests the IRA had a division of labor, with accounts pushing both sides of the political spectrum. It is also known that IRA activity crossed multiple platform boundaries, but it is unclear whether the IRA division of labor likewise extended across platforms. This ambiguity opens an interesting question about whether IRA-sponsored trolls are more similar to each other across platforms or more similar to the accounts in their respective platforms. This difference has implications for detecting cross-platform information campaigns.
